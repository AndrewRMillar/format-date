# Format date

This small repository was solely created for me to have a place where I could find an array for the months days of the week. And where I could leave a function which converts a date string epoch time stamp or a comma serated list of time indications, year, month, day, hour, minute, millisecond. So like `new Date()` but then slightly different.
